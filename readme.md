# Today I Learned...

A collection of concise write-ups and code snippets on those small nuggets of information I'd otherwise forget.


So far, I have learned 11 things.

## Usage
To create a new article:

1. Create a new .md file (and a new folder, if it's a new category).
1. The title of the new article will be the first level one heading in the file. Use '#', not 'H1'.
1. Once all new articles are added, commit changes to git. Assuming `python-githooks` is installed and set up, this `readme.md` should be automatically regenerated (the test suite will also run, and Python files will be blackened). 
1. If edits are made directly in the GitHub editor **make sure to `git pull` the latest version before committing any new articles to the repo locally, or you'll lose the remote changes.

## About
[Jim Anderson](https://github.com/jima80525) suggested that I build a "Today I Learned..." repo when I asked on the [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) Slack channel how people were storing their code snippets.
Jim's reward for this kindness was that I shamelessly copied [his own TIL](https://github.com/jima80525/til). Thank you Jim, for the suggestion and inspiration!
